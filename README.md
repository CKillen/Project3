# Voyager

Voyager is a Space Invaders/Galaga/Galaxian/etc. inspired, web based real-time multiplayer game.  Voyager makes use of **[socket.io](https://socket.io)** to facilitate the real time multiplayer functionality of the game, and **[phaser.io](https://phaser.io)** to facilitate the actual game display and logic.  Our team is utilizing **[React.js](https://reactjs.org)** for the frontend, and **[node.js](https://nodejs.org)/[express](https://expressjs.com)** for the backend.

## Features

#### Real-Time Multiplayer Gameplay
